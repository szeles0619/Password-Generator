# Password-Generator

In this project I had to create a password generator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A user who visit this website they will have to enter a nummber between 10-64 and they will get the length of the password from the chosen number.

Also they will be asked to choose the following: 

    - Special characters.
    - Numbers,
    - Lowercase and Uppercase laters.

## Usage

As a user,
I WANT to use the app,
SO THAT I can generate passwords that fit my criteria
GIVEN the password generator app.

WHEN I click on the "generate password" button
THEN I can see pop up windows where I can specify the password length and the types of characters I want to include

WHEN I specify all the criteria,
THEN I can see a corresponding password on the screen


## Troubleshooting

Keep it in mind that if you would like to create a new password you will have to refresh your web browser.
